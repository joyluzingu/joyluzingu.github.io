During three days, I presented Wehealth at a booth at the 2024 Preparedness summit of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) held in Cleveland, Ohio. Wehealth Notify is a free app available to the general public. It monitors verified sources of health & safety information and sends enhanced alerts with personalized action plans. Sources include the National Weather Service, the CDC, and various state, city, county and tribal agencies nationwide.
