During three days, I presented Wehealth at a booth at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) annual conference of 2024 held in Pittsburgh, PA. Wehealth Notify is a free app available to the general public. It monitors verified sources of health & safety information and sends enhanced alerts with personalized action plans. Sources include the National Weather Service, the CDC, and various state, city, county and tribal agencies nationwide
